Hi, I'm Roshan Mathew Tom, a Staff Engineer at Western Digital Corporation.

## What I do

My research is on hard drives. Yes, you heard that right. Hard drives. You may ask, why are you doing research on Hard disks? Aren't they a really old technology? Well, no. You see... I am working on something called Heat-assisted magnetic recording hard disk drives. With this technology, you could store 3 to 4 times more data than traditional hard drives. Imagine this: Hard disk drives weigh less than 2 lbs but can store about 50 TB? That's HAMR for you. It uses lasers, or more specifically, surface plasmons to write data on disks. That's a cool technology indeed. 

Of course, I am not the only researcher working on this. Hundreds of engineers and scientists have been working on this for the last two decades. My research (and contribution) is on a very small part of this hard disk drives - The head disk interface. This is the small region where the magnetic coils read and write data on the disk. Temperatures in this region exceed 800 Kelvin (that's a thousand degrees!). It is only a few nanometers in the vertical direction, but several microns in the other directions. Many tests have revealed the presence of contamination (called smear) during write operations. No one likes these contaminations, so I am developing numerical methods to simulate them and studying theories that cause them them. 

The numerical methods I have used are:

1. Traditional Finite Element Methods
2. A particle-based method: Direct Simulation Monte Carlo
3. A novel computational technique: A hybrid continuum-MD simulation


The physical methods I have studied are:
1. Evaporation/Condensation
2. Ballistic Jumps
3. Optical Tweezers


## Bio

I graduated with a Civil Engineering degree with honors from IIT Madras (Chennai, India). I learned the basics of engineering - Programming, RC Design, Mechanics, Deep Learning, and so much more. I also graduated with the highest CGPA in my class, received the Frank and Margaret Lucas Fellowship.
