Work experience
===
1. University of California at Berkeley
Graduate Student Researcher, Computer Mechanics Lab (Aug 2020 - Present)
  * Conducted Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) simulations of air-bearings in Hard drives.
  * Modified open-source code (SPARTA) to include the Consistent Boltzmann Algorithm (CBA).
  * Developed hybrid numerical technique to study lubricant kinetics by calculating thermophoresis, drag, and lift forces on cyclinderical nanoparticles. And simulated contamination patterns on the head surface of hard disk drives. 
  * Engaged in close collaboration with industry to supplement research.


2. Western Digital Corporation
Thermal and Optical Modeling Intern (May – Aug 2022, May – Aug 2023)
  * Studied condensation phenomena in high-pressure air-bearings.
  * Used Redlich-Kwong and Peng-Robinson equation of states to conduct vapor-liquid equilibrium of water and compared it against ideal gas law. 
  * Used equations derived from Rayleigh approximation to study optical forces in head-disk interfaces.
  * Studied the drag forces acting on smear nanoparticles in C++.

3. Indian Institute of Technology Madras
Undergraduate Researcher, (Aug 2020 - Present)
  * Developed the form of the constitutive relations for rate-independent dissipative mechanical processes.
  * Compared experimental results with proposed theoretical framework and found errors to be less than 10%.

4. Hokkaido University
STSI Summer Research Intern, Bridge and Structural Design Lab (June – July 2018)
  * Developed deep learning model to classify cracks on various surfaces. 
  * Used physics informed data augmentation to improve accuracy of CNN model.
  * Utilized patch-wise analysis on large images to locate cracks.


5. Indian Institute of Technology Bombay Mumbai, India
  * Research Intern, Structural Evaluation and Testing Lab  (Dec 2016 – Jan 2017)
  * Studied the valorization of Industrial by-products in concrete.
  * Conducted experiments to quantify various properties of concrete and mortar.
